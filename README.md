# 100daysofcode


1. ~ 29th of June 2021

Learning about how I can refactor my website by deleting all code that repeats more than 2 times into one and giving the new class to the html elements it was repeating in.

Learning about Web Design: "Color Theory"; How different Typographies set different moods; Effective User Interface (UI) Design; User Experience (UX) Design; Learning to Design a Website on canva.com

2. ~ 30th of June 
Making my own design on canva.com [https://www.canva.com/design/DAEiy2GrZoo/vg7DATZ0FsGPAjERXDl8bw/view?website#4].

Going through JavaScript's foundamentals again: Alerts; //comments; Data types; Variables; Assigning Variables' data as a data type to another Variable;
With Angela and Andrei's course on udemy + freecodecamp as the main resource.

3. ~ 1st of July

Data types in depth:
Numbers (2,5,10) you can add them (ex.: N+N = B which will make the variable be equal to store B) same goes for: "-"; for multiplications the asterisk sign.
You can increment a value by 1 simply by putting value++. 
var myValue += 5;       var myValue -= 5;       var myValue *asterisk sign*= 5;       var myValue /= 5;    
String -> var myValue = "words go here or leave empty";   //in case you are a masochist and want to use " inside the quotation marks of a string data type then put a \ before " so Javascript will ignore it and not end the value input.
